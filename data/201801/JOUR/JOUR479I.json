  "description": "Prerequisite: A university statistics course.\n\nStudents will be introduced to the expanding ways the \"visual\" is embedded in all we do and all that we are. Students will tackle challenges of why \"seeing\" matters and in so doing will learn visual theory. Media have become less about words and more about sight: Students will consider the ethics and impact of images on people and politics and turn those lessons into an examination of the methods of research projects where images are the data. What do we see? What don't we see? Students will analyze and deconstruct images created by others and use those insights to inform their own creation of a culminating visual journalism research project.",
