  "description": "Prerequisite: JOUR320. This course will take an in-depth look at the gig economy -- think Uber drivers and freelance journalists -- which is expanding across the U.S. labor market. The gig economy is characterized by the prevalence of contractors and contingent workers who make a living on jobs that often provide low pay and few, if any, benefits. Students will write real stories that explain what is driving Maryland's gig economy, how workers feel about being a part of the gig economy and how they handle a range of thorny issues, from obtaining medical insurance to getting a fair wage for their work.",
