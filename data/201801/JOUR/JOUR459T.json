  "credits": "3",
  "description": "This class will examine the emerging tensions and challenges of maintaining the flow of accurate, independent news to the public using four case studies: The United States, Russia and two others. We will examine the notion of \"press freedom\" as a basic human right, opponents of that view, and global trends in the last decade that are undermining that freedom, including the contradictory role the U.S. has played in both strengthening and weakening press freedom in emerging democracies. Then, we will explore forms of censorship, the state's and private industry's role in the shaping of the media environment and the rise of disinformation/fake news.",
