  "description": "Restricted to first semester freshmen in the College of Arts and Humanities.\n\nStudents will explore the connection between gender, media, and culture. They will pose questions about how various communication and cultural practices shape the manifestations and representations (or misrepresentations) of complex and varied gendered identities, whether feminine, masculine, or queer. They will also fully engage in a wide-ranging discussion of the ties between gender, race, ethnicity, culture, and mediated communication from a multidisciplinary perspective, stretching across the fields of communication, gender studies, sociology, anthropology, and history.",
