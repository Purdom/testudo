  "description": "The capstone of the four-semester College Park Scholars Justice and Legal thought citation program is an exploration of justice and law within a rigorous academic and experiential framework. Students must develop and perform practicum internships in professional law related settings. In all settings, students must interact directly with legal professionals in law related fields and through law-related institutions under the supervision of legal professionals and program staff. In conjunction with the experiential component, students will synthesize their experience within the learning outcomes of the Justice and Legal Thought Program through an innovative final project culminating in a poster presentation.",
