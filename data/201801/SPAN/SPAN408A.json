  "description": "This course will explore discursive representations of individuals from the Spanish-speaking world who in some aspect did not present themselves as heteronormative or who were judged as raros (queer) by society. Putting a critical lens to art, drama, fiction, film, and journalism, we will interrogate what it means to be (ab)normal in terms of gender expression, sexuality, and anatomical sex in Spain and Spanish-speaking Latin America at critical junctures in history. One of the principal purposes of this course is to define what queer means from a current critical perspective and how criticism can serve as a tool to analyze cultural discourse. We will also examine how the historical debates regarding genitalia, masculinity, femininity, and sexuality evolved from a moralist perspective to a medico-legal one over time.",
