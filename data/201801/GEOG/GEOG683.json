  "description": "Timely and accurate Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) is essential for protecting people from hazardous events such as floods, wildfires, tsunamis, hurricanes, industrial accidents, and terrorist attacks. GEOINT plays a critical role in all four stages of emergency management: preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. The use of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 terror attacks are two of the case studies that are discussed during this course. You will develop a deeper understanding of the emergency management successes and failures that occurred during these historic and deadly events, and learn the technical skills to develop and disseminate GEOINT products that support decision-making at all four stages of emergency management.",
