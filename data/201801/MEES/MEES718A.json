  "description": "Measurements since 2004 indicate a decreasing trend in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) flow intensity. Is this the beginning of a global warming induced AMOC slowdown or shutdown? We will put together a review paper of modern and paleo observations of the AMOC with our goal to put modern AMOC changes into their histo- rical context with the best available data, as well as to summarize how we might clarify remaining questions and ambiguities. Taught over the Interactive Video Network (IVN).",
