  "title": "Special Topics in Israel Studies; Understanding the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict through Opposing Histories",
  "credits": "3",
  "description": "Not open to students who have taken ISRL289I. Credit will be granted for HONR338A or ISRL329D. Israelis and Palestinians have been fighting over the Land of Palestine/Israel for over a century, but both sides date their relationship to the Land back many centuries, even millenia. We will look at the history but especially the \"narratives\" that the two sides employ to explain and justify, both to themselves and others, their claims to the land, and how these narratives have both molded the shape of the conflict and been molded by it, and changed over time. This is not solely a history course, though it will cover the relevant history. It will focus on the importance of narratives to the continuation of the conflict, as well as elements relating to identity, religion, archaeology, morality, and human rights. No previous knowledge is expected, but those with such knowledge will find it useful.",
