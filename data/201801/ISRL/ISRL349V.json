  "description": "Also offered as ARAB398F and FILM335. Credit granted for FILM335, ARAB398F or ISRL349V How does the Arab-Israeli Conflict represent itself? How do the actors within this conflict (and some from outside) come to understand this conflict by representing it to themselves? The prism of film will touch on many of the various discourses (history, society, culture). The course will investigate whether the medium of film represents and formulates this Conflict in a particular way.",
