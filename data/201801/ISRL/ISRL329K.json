  "description": "Also offered as JWST319K. Credit granted for JWST319K or ISRL329K. Part of the Zionist cultural project involved creating a new Jewish masculinity that would replace the diasporic sissy Jew with a strong, healthy new Jewry of Muscle. Using literary and filmic sources, we will analyze how these Zionist and Israeli cultural productions served to build (and sometimes undermine) this new model of Jewish masculinity.",
