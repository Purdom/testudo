  "description": "Students who are considering a career in education will consider information about the teaching profession. Students reflect on their personal strengths, identify areas of growth, and examine their predisposition to work with young children with and without disabilities. They will discuss the nature of teaching, the moral and philosophic underpinnings that influenced their decision to enter into the teaching professions, as well as the roles and responsibilities of teachers and the characteristics and qualities for effective teachers (teaching styles and teacher's primary role in the classroom).",
