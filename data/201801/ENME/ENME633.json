  "description": "An examination of the interactions between molecules, which govern thermodynamics relevant to engineering, will be conducted. We will investigate both classical and statistical approaches to thermodynamics for understanding topics such as phase change, wetting of surfaces, chemical reactions, adsorption, and electrochemical processes. Statistical approaches and molecular simulation tools will be studied to understand how molecular analysis can be translated to macroscopic phenomena.",
