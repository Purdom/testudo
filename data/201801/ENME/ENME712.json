  "description": "This course is designed to offer systemic coverage of the methodologies for measurement and data analysis of thermal and fluid processes at the graduate level. The course materials will cover three broad categories: (1) Fundamentals of thermal and fluid processes in single phase and multi phase flows as relates to this course; Measurement and Instrumentation techniques for measurement of basic quantities such as pressure, temperature, flow rate, heat flux, etc., and (3) Experimental Design and Planning, sources of errors in measurements, and uncertainty analysis.",
