  "description": "How do different forms of media shape the stories which circulate about race, femininities, masculinities, ethnicities, sexualities, religiosity power and difference? How have various media formats been used to disrupt dominant stories, to tell new stories, and to create differing understandings of citizenship? This course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of womens studies and an exploration of the ways that media has been used as a platform for racial justice, feminist activism, and cultural transformation, with a principal focus on the expressions of women of color.",
