  "description": "The magic and mystery of character design will be unmasked! Students will learn various building and finishing techniques on how to make multiple styles of puppets and masks, and exploring performance techniques upon the completion of each project. Demonstration of techniques will be carefully guided by the instructor. We'll work with geodesic cardboard design, clay character design and paper mach positive molds, two-part negative mold/neoprene technique and found object design. Students will also compose a design notebook of sketches, notes, found pictures and brainstorms. Designs by the instructor will provide some inspiration for shape, size and paint finishing, as well as examples by Handspring Puppets, Jim Henson Company and many more. Students will be encouraged to share examples of inspiring works for the class to learn from as well. Projects range from a single class session, to several week processes. Students must pay a $25 lab fee.",
