In this advanced course, we will be emphasizing administrative and artistic development for the upcoming season at Andy's Summer Playhouse, named 2018 SUMMER OF LEGACY. Andy's Summer Playhouse is a 48 year old non-for-profit children's theater in Wilton, NH, focusing on original works written, directed and designed by professionals while performed and operated by children ages 8-18. The productions are intended for audiences of all ages. In this course, students will be asked to investigate and develop the programs offered while also thinking outside of the box regarding marketing and outreach for the local communities around the theater. This course offers real-life investigations on how to operate and grow a small non-for-profit performing arts organization while also learning the entrepreneurial skills to be an independent artist.",
