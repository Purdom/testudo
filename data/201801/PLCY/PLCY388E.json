  "description": "Recognizing the urgency of today's political and ecological challenges, students will cultivate their voice and sharpen their understanding of sustainability policy, concepts, and institutions to create lasting impact in their communities and world. An inquiry into personal and shared values across the three pillars of sustainability - economic, environmental, and social - will provide a foundation for adapting and working toward aspirational goals at all levels of engagement, from the University's Climate Action Plan to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing on Youth Service America's \"ASAP\" model for taking action (Awareness, Service, Advocacy, Philanthropy) students will then undertake hands-on awareness and advocacy projects that expand their capacity as transformational leaders in building a more just and sustainable society.",
