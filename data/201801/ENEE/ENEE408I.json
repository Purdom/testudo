  "description": "Prerequisite: ENEE322 Electrical or Computer Engineering seniors in their last semester. The course involves students in the design,development, and application of autonomous robotic systems.The robots are 4 wheeled vehicles with on-board sensors (cameras, acoustic sensors),computers and wireless communications capabilities. The students work in teams to program the robots to accomplish a task individually and in teams of 2 or more more robots. Applications vary from semester to semester, including racing with passing, soccer, search and identify.",
