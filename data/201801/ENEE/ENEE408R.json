Recommended Co-requisites: ENEE474, ENEE463, ENEE426, ENEE440, or ENEE459V.\n\nA capstone course on the design of safe, light and utilitarian electric bikes for personal transportation. It is systems level and will make use of a combination of off-the-shelf and custom-made components. These vehicles must meet either one of these design challenges such as extended range superior terrain climbing capability. In addition, the vehicle must contain a plethora of wireless sensors for safety and convenience, such as GPS, on-board cameras, theft deterrent systems, communications and navigation. It must be able to operate under different road conditions, at all hours and even in slightly inclement weather.",
