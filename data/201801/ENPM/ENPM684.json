  "description": "Review of basic rocket propulsion principles including performance, design, analysis, nozzle theory, and thermodynamic relationships. Students will conduct performance analyses of solid, liquid, and hybrid rocket motors. Design projects will be focused to allow students to develop a basic understanding for the challenges associated with the design of chemical rocket engines/motors. We will examine the classification of solid and liquid propellants/fuels/oxidizers and their combustion characteristics.",
