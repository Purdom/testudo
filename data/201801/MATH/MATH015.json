  "credits": "3",
  "description": "A review of Intermediate High School Algebra intended for students preparing for MATH115. It is taught 5 days per week for the first 5 weeks, then leads directly into a special section of MATH115, the same semester, which also meets 5 days per week. Continuation in MATH115 is conditional on the student passing the MATHEMATICS PLACEMENT EXAM at the appropriate level. Topics include exponents, polynomials, linear equations in one and two variables, quadratic equations, as well as polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithm functions and trigonometry. MATH015 does not carry any credit toward any degree at the University, nor is it graded. It leads directly to MATH115 (or MATH111 or MATH113 or MATH110), or MATH003, all of which are graded.",
