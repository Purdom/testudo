  "credits": "3",
  "description": "A review of Intermediate High School Algebra intended for students preparing for MATH107. It is taught 5 days per week for the first 5 weeks, then leads directly into a special section of MATH107, the same semester, which also meets 5 days per week. Continuation in MATH107 is conditional on the student passing the MATHEMATICS PLACEMENT EXAM at the appropriate level. Topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, operations on polynomials, factoring, solutions of quadratic equations, as well as exponential and logarithm functions. MATH007 does not carry any credit toward any degree at the University, nor is it graded. It leads to either MATH107 or MATH003, both of which are graded.",
