  "description": "This course examines how different theories and definitions from the field of Performance Studies, and studies of Asian American performance, can help us analyze Asian American identities, experiences, and issues. Students will extend performance theory beyond the normative range of performance objects to under-theorized Asian American modes of performance, such as spoken word, hip hop, standup comedy, and YouTube videos, to cultural sites and practices that are not usually as a performative, such as campuses, political protests, and sports. We will consider how these analyses and performances can deepen our understanding of the body, immigration, empire, war, militarization, desire, loss, resistance, masculinity, femininity, and power in general.",
