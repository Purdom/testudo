  "description": "Prerequisite: PHYS174. Introduces students to the skills needed to become a successful physicist, but rarely taught in traditional undergraduate physics coursework. The skills covered will include scientific reading and writing skills, presentation skills as well as tools commonly used in physics research. As much as possible, this course will allow students to do real science as opposed to cookie-cutter experiments with known results.",
